Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy, love does not boast, love is not proud.
Love is not rude, love is not self-seeking, love is not easily angered, love keeps no record of wrongs.
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth.
Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
Love never fails.
